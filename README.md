 # (N)ormalizing flow (A)lgorithms beyond (Z)ero-variance training

Dicrete and continuous normalizing flows for conditional and unconditional density estimation and simulation based inference. In addition to standard training uncertainty quantification tools are provided to estimate the variance in flow predictions such as exact and approximate Bayesian flows and Monte Carlo dropout.
